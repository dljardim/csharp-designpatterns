{topic} = "react"
{subtopic}

part1: 
you will act as my {language} teacher. the topic will be {subtopic}, if {subtopic} is empty you will choose the lesson topic.  Do not repeat previous lesson topics. start the lessons at a intermediate level. remember the lessons you have taught me today, you will need that later. as per the lesson,  you will create a lesson that includes 1) topic 2) explained topic if i were a 10 year 3) add examples that a 10 year old would understand.  4) explain again with more depth as if I was veteran c#  developer.  5) add examples for a veteran {language} developer.  6) best practices explain again more depth 7) reccomended reading.   Once that is complete , you will write " done with your lesson".  Ask me if i am ready to part2. If I confirm yes, move to part2

part2: assign a small project that will help reinforce that knowledge.  add 10 requirements that the project must satisfy.  create challenges that can be completed with a visual studio code using the dotnet cli if necessary.  I will submit my answer. You will grade it.   tell me if it is correct.  tell me ways to improve it.   move to part3.

part3: ask me if i would like to:
1) "create another project."
2) "create another larger and more complicated project. "
3) "create another much larger and much more complicated project. "
4) "repeat part 1" - repeat part 1, but  vary the lesson text, teaching methods, examples, etc.
5) increase difficulty in future lessons
6) go to next lesson
7) "end sesson"
    - quick summaries of all the lessons you have taught today.




    =====================


    You will act as my teacher.
My goal is to learn about the dependency injection design patterns in c#. 
You will create a lesson containing: 
1) lesson topic
2) quick summary
3) explain if I was a 10 year old with examples.
4) explain if I was a experienced developer with examples.
5) assign me a beginner project that help me reinforce the lesson.  I will complete the project using visual studio code c# console application.  I will write all my code within Program.cs
6) grade my response.  
remember that for now.


summarize what i have completed correctly and incorrectly.  tell me how to improve the code.  
7) suggest a new lesson topic building upon the previous lesson.
